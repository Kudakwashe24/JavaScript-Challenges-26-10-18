JavaScript Challenges

I was given a JavaScript challenge to do by my lecture.

1. Created my JavaScript and HTML files
2. Managed to do the console
3. Used numbers, maths and abs
4. Used the console.log to output my negative numbers

The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
Did the challenge on arrays.
With the numbers I've choosen< the out come is doubled.
